        I'm Pragna, a graduate international student at Purdue University Fort
        Wayne. I'm pursuing my Masters in Computer Science. <br />
        I'm passionate about travelling around and this is a website I created
        to share my travel experiences!
        <br /> So far, I've travelled to 5 states in the US and you can find
        some of the photos here.
